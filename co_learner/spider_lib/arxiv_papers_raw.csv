2410.18980v1,Very massive stars and Nitrogen-emitting galaxies,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18980v1,"Recent studies of high-redshift galaxies using JWST, such as GN-z11 revealedhighly elevated levels of nitrogen (N). This phenomenon extends togravitationally-lensed galaxies like the Sunburst Arc at z = 2.37, as well asto globular clusters (GCs). We propose that this originates from the presenceof very massive stars (VMSs) with masses ranging from 100 to 1000\,\Msun. TheHe {\sc ii} observed in the Sunburst Arc could also stem from thedisproportionately large contribution of VMSs. We build an entirely newFramework for massive star evolution which is no longer set by Dutch or othermass-loss ""recipes"" but which take the physics of $\Gamma$ or $L/M$-dependentwinds into account. We discuss the mass-loss kink and the transition mass-lossrate between optically thin and thick winds, before we study the evaporativemass-loss history of VMSs. Our novel evolution models exhibit verticalevolution in the HR-diagram from the zero-age main sequence due to aself-regulatory effect driven by their wind-dominated nature, and we discusswhat wind physics sets the stellar upper-mass limit. Our estimate for theSunburst Arc in Vink (2023) suggests that the significant amounts of N found instar-forming galaxies likely arise from VMSs. We evaluate the strengths andweaknesses of previous hypotheses, including fast rotating massive stars andsupermassive stars (SMSs), and we conclude that only our VMS model satisfiesthe relevant criteria. Finally, we advocate for the inclusion of VMSs inpopulation synthesis and chemical evolution models, emphasizing the need for aself-consistent wind approach, which currently does not exist. Even minorinaccuracies in mass-loss rates dramatically impact the stellar evolution ofVMS, as well as their ionizing and chemical feedback.",Jorick S. Vink,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A
2410.18979v1,PixelGaussian: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Reconstruction from Arbitrary Views,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18979v1,"We propose PixelGaussian, an efficient feed-forward framework for learninggeneralizable 3D Gaussian reconstruction from arbitrary views. Most existingmethods rely on uniform pixel-wise Gaussian representations, which learn afixed number of 3D Gaussians for each view and cannot generalize well to moreinput views. Differently, our PixelGaussian dynamically adapts both theGaussian distribution and quantity based on geometric complexity, leading tomore efficient representations and significant improvements in reconstructionquality. Specifically, we introduce a Cascade Gaussian Adapter to adjustGaussian distribution according to local geometry complexity identified by akeypoint scorer. CGA leverages deformable attention in context-awarehypernetworks to guide Gaussian pruning and splitting, ensuring accuraterepresentation in complex regions while reducing redundancy. Furthermore, wedesign a transformer-based Iterative Gaussian Refiner module that refinesGaussian representations through direct image-Gaussian interactions. OurPixelGaussian can effectively reduce Gaussian redundancy as input viewsincrease. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale ACID andRealEstate10K datasets, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performancewith good generalization to various numbers of views.

2410.18978v1,Framer: Interactive Frame Interpolation,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18978v1,"We propose Framer for interactive frame interpolation, which targetsproducing smoothly transitioning frames between two images as per usercreativity. Concretely, besides taking the start and end frames as inputs, ourapproach supports customizing the transition process by tailoring thetrajectory of some selected keypoints. Such a design enjoys two clear benefits.First, incorporating human interaction mitigates the issue arising fromnumerous possibilities of transforming one image to another, and in turnenables finer control of local motions. Second, as the most basic form ofinteraction, keypoints help establish the correspondence across frames,enhancing the model to handle challenging cases (e.g., objects on the start andend frames are of different shapes and styles). It is noteworthy that oursystem also offers an ""autopilot"" mode, where we introduce a module to estimatethe keypoints and refine the trajectory automatically, to simplify the usage inpractice. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the appealing performanceof Framer on various applications, such as image morphing, time-lapse videogeneration, cartoon interpolation, etc. The code, the model, and the interfacewill be released to facilitate further research.",Wen Wang,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A
2410.18977v1,MotionCLR: Motion Generation and Training-free Editing via Understanding Attention Mechanisms,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18977v1,"This research delves into the problem of interactive editing of human motiongeneration. Previous motion diffusion models lack explicit modeling of theword-level text-motion correspondence and good explainability, hencerestricting their fine-grained editing ability. To address this issue, wepropose an attention-based motion diffusion model, namely MotionCLR, with CLeaRmodeling of attention mechanisms. Technically, MotionCLR models the in-modalityand cross-modality interactions with self-attention and cross-attention,respectively. More specifically, the self-attention mechanism aims to measurethe sequential similarity between frames and impacts the order of motionfeatures. By contrast, the cross-attention mechanism works to find thefine-grained word-sequence correspondence and activate the correspondingtimesteps in the motion sequence. Based on these key properties, we develop aversatile set of simple yet effective motion editing methods via manipulatingattention maps, such as motion (de-)emphasizing, in-place motion replacement,and example-based motion generation, etc. For further verification of theexplainability of the attention mechanism, we additionally explore thepotential of action-counting and grounded motion generation ability viaattention maps. Our experimental results show that our method enjoys goodgeneration and editing ability with good explainability.",Ling-Hao Chen,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A

This has led to the introduction of multiple LMMbenchmarks to evaluate LMMs on different tasks. However, most existing LMMevaluation benchmarks are predominantly English-centric. In this work, wedevelop a comprehensive LMM evaluation benchmark for the Arabic language torepresent a large population of over 400 million speakers. The proposedbenchmark, named CAMEL-Bench, comprises eight diverse domains and 38sub-domains including, multi-image understanding, complex visual perception,handwritten document understanding, video understanding, medical imaging, plantdiseases, and remote sensing-based land use understanding to evaluate broadscenario generalizability. Our CAMEL-Bench comprises around 29,036 questionsthat are filtered from a larger pool of samples, where the quality is manuallyverified by native speakers to ensure reliable model assessment. We conductevaluations of both closed-source, including GPT-4 series, and open-sourceLMMs. Our analysis reveals the need for substantial improvement, especiallyamong the best open-source models, with even the closed-source GPT-4o achievingan overall score of 62%.

2410.18975v1,Unbounded: A Generative Infinite Game of Character Life Simulation,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18975v1,"We introduce the concept of a generative infinite game, a video game thattranscends the traditional boundaries of finite, hard-coded systems by usinggenerative models. Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite andinfinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to createUnbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated ingenerative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox lifesimulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual characterin a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-endedmechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order todevelop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visualgeneration domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilledlarge language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics,narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamicregional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensuresconsistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multipleenvironments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitativeanalysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, userinstruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for bothcharacters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.",Jialu Li,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A
2410.18974v1,3D-Adapter: Geometry-Consistent Multi-View Diffusion for High-Quality 3D Generation,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18974v1,"Multi-view image diffusion models have significantly advanced open-domain 3Dobject generation. However, most existing models rely on 2D networkarchitectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometricconsistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-inmodule designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusionmodels. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: foreach denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediatemulti-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes therendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through featureaddition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward versionbased on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizingneural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapternot only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view modelssuch as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generationusing the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase thebroad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results intext-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.",Hansheng Chen,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,https://github.com/Lakonik/MVEdit,235

In some cases, however, this decline is more pronounced,typically due to disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Early detection ofanomalous cognitive decline is crucial, as it can facilitate timelyprofessional intervention. While medical data can help in this detection, itoften involves invasive procedures. An alternative approach is to employnon-intrusive techniques such as speech or handwriting analysis, which do notnecessarily affect daily activities. This survey reviews the most relevantmethodologies that use deep learning techniques to automate the cognitivedecline estimation task, including audio, text, and visual processing. Wediscuss the key features and advantages of each modality and methodology,including state-of-the-art approaches like Transformer architecture andfoundation models. In addition, we present works that integrate differentmodalities to develop multimodal models. We also highlight the most significantdatasets and the quantitative results from studies using these resources. Fromthis review, several conclusions emerge. In most cases, the textual modalityachieves the best results and is the most relevant for detecting cognitivedecline.

Most methods relyon spotting them by analysing misclassified samples, in a semi-automatedhuman-computer validation. In contrast, we propose ConceptDrift, a method whichanalyzes the weights of a linear probe, learned on top a foundational model. Wecapitalize on the weight update trajectory, which starts from the embedding ofthe textual representation of the class, and proceeds to drift towardsembeddings that disclose hidden biases. Different from prior work, with thisapproach we can pin-point unwanted correlations from a dataset, providing morethan just possible explanations for the wrong predictions. We empirically provethe efficacy of our method, by significantly improving zero-shot performancewith biased-augmented prompting. Our method is not bounded to a singlemodality, and we experiment in this work with both image (Waterbirds, CelebA,Nico++) and text datasets (CivilComments).",Cristian Daniel Păduraru,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A

In thispaper, we show that in a $2 \to 2$ process, including a bosonic final particle(e.g., an axion or dark photon), the stimulated emission occurs as well due toa small angle scattering of the thermal mother particles and thus thephenomenon is more universal. Two important conclusions follow: (1) Care mustbe taken when studying the freeze-in production of a bosonic dark matter, asthe abundance and momentum distribution of dark matter can differ significantlydue to this effect. (2) eV-mass-range bosonic dark matter is special andtheoretically well-motivated because models for freeze-in or other thermalproduction of dark matter include the parameter region of cold eV dark matter.We also study the dark matter mass effect for the stimulated emission.",Kodai Sakurai,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A

A Survey and Evaluation on Detection Assumptions,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18966v1,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great performance acrossvarious benchmarks, showing potential as general-purpose task solvers. However,as LLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of data, a significant concern intheir evaluation is data contamination, where overlap between training data andevaluation datasets inflates performance assessments. While multiple approacheshave been developed to identify data contamination, these approaches rely onspecific assumptions that may not hold universally across different settings.To bridge this gap, we systematically review 47 papers on data contaminationdetection, categorize the underlying assumptions, and assess whether they havebeen rigorously validated. We identify and analyze eight categories ofassumptions and test three of them as case studies. Our analysis reveals thatwhen classifying instances used for pretraining LLMs, detection approachesbased on these three assumptions perform close to random guessing, suggestingthat current LLMs learn data distributions rather than memorizing individualinstances. Overall, this work underscores the importance of approaches clearlystating their underlying assumptions and testing their validity across variousscenarios.",Yujuan Fu,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A

We introduce Nystrom initialization,which significantly improves the global convergence of Scaled Gradient Descent(ScaledGD) in both symmetric and asymmetric matrix factorization tasks.Specifically, we prove that ScaledGD with Nystrom initialization achievesquadratic convergence in cases where only linear rates were previously known.Furthermore, we extend this initialization to low-rank adapters (LoRA) commonlyused for finetuning foundation models. Our approach, NoRA, i.e., LoRA withNystrom initialization, demonstrates superior performance across variousdownstream tasks and model scales, from 1B to 7B parameters, in large languageand diffusion models.",Bingcong Li,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A

Recent advancements in large-scaleauto-regressive models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across variousreasoning tasks. However, these models often struggle with fundamental aspectsof spatial reasoning, particularly in answering questions like ""Where am I?""and ""What will I see?"". While some attempts have been done, existing approachestypically treat them as separate tasks, failing to capture their interconnectednature. In this paper, we present Generative Spatial Transformer (GST), a novelauto-regressive framework that jointly addresses spatial localization and viewprediction. Our model simultaneously estimates the camera pose from a singleimage and predicts the view from a new camera pose, effectively bridging thegap between spatial awareness and visual prediction. The proposed innovativecamera tokenization method enables the model to learn the joint distribution of2D projections and their corresponding spatial perspectives in anauto-regressive manner. This unified training paradigm demonstrates that jointoptimization of pose estimation and novel view synthesis leads to improvedperformance in both tasks, for the first time, highlighting the inherentrelationship between spatial awareness and visual prediction.",Junyi Chen,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A

Human forecasters frequently rely onadditional information, such as background knowledge or constraints, which canbe efficiently communicated through natural language. However, the ability ofexisting forecasting models to effectively integrate this textual informationremains an open question. To address this, we introduce ""Context is Key"" (CiK),a time series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diversetypes of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate bothmodalities. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models,time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simpleyet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods onour benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporatingcontextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-basedforecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings.

In contrast,consistency models, a new generative family, achieve competitive performancewith significantly faster sampling. These models are trained either throughconsistency distillation, which leverages pretrained diffusion models, orconsistency training/tuning directly from raw data. In this work, we propose anovel framework for understanding consistency models by modeling the denoisingprocess of the diffusion model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and framingconsistency model training as the value estimation through TemporalDifference~(TD) Learning. More importantly, this framework allows us to analyzethe limitations of current consistency training/tuning strategies. Built uponEasy Consistency Tuning (ECT), we propose Stable Consistency Tuning (SCT),which incorporates variance-reduced learning using the score identity.

This performance gap deepens the digital divide, preventing developers usingLRPLs from benefiting equally from LLM advancements and reinforcing disparitiesin innovation within underrepresented programming communities. While generatingadditional training data for LRPLs is promising, it faces two key challenges:manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, and LLM-generated LRPL code isoften of subpar quality. The underlying cause of this issue is the gap betweennatural language to programming language gap (NL-PL Gap), which is especiallypronounced in LRPLs due to limited aligned data. In this work, we introduce anovel approach called Bridge-Coder, which leverages LLMs' intrinsiccapabilities to enhance the performance on LRPLs. Our method consists of twokey stages. Bridge Generation, where we create high-quality dataset byutilizing LLMs' general knowledge understanding, proficiency in HRPLs, andin-context learning abilities. Then, we apply the Bridged Alignment, whichprogressively improves the alignment between NL instructions and LRPLs.Experimental results across multiple LRPLs show that Bridge-Coder significantlyenhances model performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizationof our approach.

Traditional methodsusually break this task into multiple subtasks, each requiring complextransformations between different data representations. For instance, densereconstruction through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) involves converting imagesinto key points, optimizing camera parameters, and estimating structures.Afterward, accurate sparse reconstructions are required for further densemodeling, which is subsequently fed into task-specific neural networks. Thismulti-step process results in considerable processing time and increasedengineering complexity.  In this work, we present the Large Spatial Model (LSM), which processesunposed RGB images directly into semantic radiance fields. LSM simultaneouslyestimates geometry, appearance, and semantics in a single feed-forwardoperation, and it can generate versatile label maps by interacting withlanguage at novel viewpoints. Leveraging a Transformer-based architecture, LSMintegrates global geometry through pixel-aligned point maps. To enhance spatialattribute regression, we incorporate local context aggregation with multi-scalefusion, improving the accuracy of fine local details. To tackle the scarcity oflabeled 3D semantic data and enable natural language-driven scene manipulation,we incorporate a pre-trained 2D language-based segmentation model into a3D-consistent semantic feature field.

However, this comes at the cost of slower and moreexpensive inference. Early-exiting is a promising approach for improving theefficiency of LLM inference by enabling next token prediction at intermediatelayers. Yet, the large vocabulary size in modern LLMs makes the confidenceestimation required for exit decisions computationally expensive, diminishingthe efficiency gains. To address this, we propose dynamically pruning thevocabulary at test time for each token. Specifically, the vocabulary is prunedat one of the initial layers, and the smaller vocabulary is then usedthroughout the rest of the forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that suchpost-hoc dynamic vocabulary pruning improves the efficiency of confidenceestimation in early-exit LLMs while maintaining competitive performance.",Jort Vincenti,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,https://github.com/matteonulli/vocabulary_pruning,0

This scenario, in principle, provides a novel way to produceprimordial black holes within the mass range of $1$ to $10^{26}$ g. We alsofind that it is not only black holes that can form in the aftermath of agravothermal evolution. In particular, we show that number-changingannihilations of the particles can create sufficient heat to halt thegravothermal evolution, thus forming a ""cannibal star"". Likewise, the pressurefrom the particle's repulsive self-interactions can form a boson star during agravothermal evolution. Thus, our study highlights that structure formation inthe early universe can have a rich complexity.",Pranjal Ralegankar,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A

We show that if these flows are laminar (layered by closednon-contractible streamlines which foliate the domain), then they must beeither parallel or circular flows. We also show that a large subset of theseshear flows are isolated from non-shear stationary states. For Poiseuille flow,$(v(y),0)=(y^2,0)$, our result shows that all stationary solutions in asufficiently small $C^2$ neighborhood are shear flows. We then show that if$v(y)=y^n$ with $n \geq 1$, then in any $C^{n-}$ neighborhood, there existsmooth non-shear steady states, traveling waves, and quasiperiodic solutions ofany number of non-commensurate frequencies. This proves the rigidity nearPoiseuille is sharp. Finally, we prove that on general compact doubly connecteddomains, laminar steady Euler flows with constant velocity on the boundary mustalso be either parallel or circular, and the domain a periodic channel or anannulus. This shows that laminar free boundary Euler solutions must haveEuclidean symmetry.",Theodore D. Drivas,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A

The formation of stars has been subject to extensive studies in thepast decades from molecular cloud to protoplanetary disk scales. It is stillnot fully understood how the surrounding material in a protostellar system,that often shows asymmetric structures with complex kinematic properties, feedsthe central protostar(s) and their disk(s). Aims. We study the spatialmorphology and kinematic properties of the molecular gas surrounding the IRS3Aand IRS3B protostellar systems in the L1448N region located in the Perseusmolecular cloud. Methods. We present 1 mm NOEMA observations of the PRODIGElarge program and analyze the kinematic properties of molecular lines. Giventhe complexity of the spectral profiles, the lines are fitted with up to threeGaussian velocity components. The clustering algorithm DBSCAN is used todisentangle the velocity components into the underlying physical structure.Results. We discover an extended gas bridge (~3000 au) surrounding both theIRS3A and IRS3B systems in six molecular line tracers (C18O, SO, DCN, H2CO,HC3N, and CH3OH). This gas bridge is oriented along the northeast-southwestdirection and shows clear velocity gradients on the order of 100 km/s/pctowards the IRS3A system. We find that the observed velocity profile isconsistent with analytical streamline models of gravitational infall towardsIRS3A. The high-velocity C18O (2-1) emission towards IRS3A indicates aprotostellar mass of ~1.2 Msun. Conclusions. While high angular resolutioncontinuum data often show IRS3A and IRS3B in isolation, molecular gasobservations reveal that these systems are still embedded within a large-scalemass reservoir with a complex spatial morphology as well as velocity profiles.The kinematic properties of the extended gas bridge are consistent withgravitational infall toward the IRS3A protostar.",C.

Yet, our current mathematical understanding of featurelearning and its relationship to generalization remain limited. In this work,we provide a random matrix analysis of how fully-connected two-layer neuralnetworks adapt to the target function after a single, but aggressive, gradientdescent step. We rigorously establish the equivalence between the updatedfeatures and an isotropic spiked random feature model, in the limit of largebatch size. For the latter model, we derive a deterministic equivalentdescription of the feature empirical covariance matrix in terms of certainlow-dimensional operators. This allows us to sharply characterize the impact oftraining in the asymptotic feature spectrum, and in particular, provides atheoretical grounding for how the tails of the feature spectrum modify withtraining. The deterministic equivalent further yields the exact asymptoticgeneralization error, shedding light on the mechanisms behind its improvementin the presence of feature learning. Our result goes beyond standard randommatrix ensembles, and therefore we believe it is of independent technicalinterest. Different from previous work, our result holds in the challengingmaximal learning rate regime, is fully rigorous and allows for finitelysupported second layer initialization, which turns out to be crucial forstudying the functional expressivity of the learned features.

We extracted NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRSspectra from 18 apertures that cover the morphological structures of 30 Dor. Wecharacterize the profiles and relative intensities of PAH emission in theseapertures. The detailed profiles of the PAH emission bands in 30 Dor are allvery similar, and compare well to those from one of the dissociation fronts(DF2) in the Orion Bar. The relative band ratios on the other hand show a muchlarger range than in the Orion Bar. The PAH emission in 30 Dor originates froma population with a higher ionization fraction than in the Orion Bar, and asize distribution that has more smaller PAHs. Since smaller PAHs typicallyphoto-fragment before larger PAHs, our findings support the hypothesis that thelower PAH emission for lower metallicities is the result of inhibition ofgrowth toward larger PAHs rather than photo-fragmentation.",Congcong Zhang,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A

The coarse temporalresolution makes it difficult to capture rapidly evolving weather events. Toaddress this limitation, we introduce an interpolation model that reconstructsthe atmospheric state between two points in time for which the state is known.The model makes use of a novel network layer that modifies the adaptive Fourierneural operator (AFNO), which has been previously used in weather predictionand other applications of machine learning to physics problems. The modulatedAFNO (ModAFNO) layer takes an embedding, here computed from the interpolationtarget time, as an additional input and applies a learned shift-scale operationinside the AFNO layers to adapt them to the target time. Thus, one model can beused to produce all intermediate time steps. Trained to interpolate between twotime steps 6 h apart, the ModAFNO-based interpolation model produces 1 hresolution intermediate time steps that are visually nearly indistinguishablefrom the actual corresponding 1 h resolution data. The model reduces the RMSEloss of reconstructing the intermediate steps by approximately 50% compared tolinear interpolation. We also demonstrate its ability to reproduce thestatistics of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and heat waves betterthan 6 h resolution data.

We proposea simple yet effective realization of PSY using posterior sampling, whicheffectively prevents privacy leakage from intermediate information and, inturn, preserves the privacy of data owners. We evaluate LoRA extended with PSYagainst state-of-the-art membership inference and data extraction attacks. Theexperiments are executed on three different LLM architectures fine-tuned onthree datasets with LoRA. In contrast to the commonly used differential privacymethod, we find that our proposed modification consistently reduces the attacksuccess rate. Meanwhile, our method has almost no negative impact on modelfine-tuning or final performance. Most importantly, PSY reveals a promisingpath toward privacy enhancement with latent space extensions.",Yulian Sun,2024-10-24,2024-10-24,,N/A
